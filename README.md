A basic version of a card flip mix and match card game.

This was my first project on my second cohort at CodeNation, the project was to create a card flip game with a variety of difficulties with a built in countdown.

I wanted to use a smooth card flip animation and used the react-card-flip package made by David Walsh.

As this was my first project I wanted to add a personal touch to the images and chose everyones favourite memes
